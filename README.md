# enfsolar_webscrabing
This project has been developed for web scraping from https://www.enfsolar.com/ website. In order to use the programme, the chrome driver must be compatible with the related version of selenium package. The enf website gives a certain number of access permissions for some information. A dynamically changing ip address vpn can be used to pull data regardless of access permission. Here, only the code information is given, and the relevant VPN is left to the user's preference. When this code runs, information will be accessible to the allowed number of times without VPN. The code asks the user to enter the country number to scrape the company and product information of the relevant country. The first time the code is run, it creates an excel file that holds the scraped information. It creates a worksheet on excel file and its name is country name and saves data on this worksheet. When the code run again it creates a new worksheet which is name new country to scrape and save data in this worksheet. If the code run for same country the code updated data on the worksheet. An example excel file is added.
